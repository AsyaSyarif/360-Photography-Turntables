# Arduino Photogrammetry ðŸ“·

Capture the photos frame by frame with that object turn automatically.

## How it's work ?
Quite simple, The Arduino controlling the shutter release of the camera, how many steppers motor rotating (degrees), the delay time between capturing, how many photos to take.
after done capturing process, you'll have many photos, that will be uploaded to the website app to render those photos.
You can use Digital Camera or even Smartphone to capture the photos,
and also you can set the amount of photos from 1 to 200. for making it simpler I've made a preset for quality menu **LOW**, **MEDIUM**, **HIGH** that can be customized as well.
